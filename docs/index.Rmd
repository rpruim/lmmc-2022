    * We are not providing a meal this year due to COVID-related uncertainties 
    * We will provide some light snacks that teams may bring with them into the competition rooms. 
    * On-campus food options are limited on Saturdays, but there are a number of 
[restaurants near campus](https://www.google.com/maps/search/restaurant+near+cavlin+university/@42.9214762,-85.5904898,15z),
especially south of campus along 28th Street (Highway 11 on some maps, but no locals call it that).

    leave the room as you found it (or better) at the end of the competition.

change, we will update here and also make masks available for anyone who does
not bring their own. Of course, individuals are welcome to choose to wear a mask
at any time.
